# amarok-idle-pause

Amarok script that pauses the player when idle.

## To Install

Simply put this in your Amarok Scripts directly, or place a link to this
directory in the scripts folder.

The scripts folder is system-dependent:
* On KUbuntu: `~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts`

So, to install on Kubuntu just do this from inside this directory:
  `ln -s $PWD ~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts`
